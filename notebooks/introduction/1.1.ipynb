    "# 1 Introduction\n",
    "This book is an introduction to the young and fast-growing field of data mining (also known\n",
    "as knowledge discovery from data, or KDD for short). The book focuses on fundamental\n",
    "data mining concepts and techniques for discovering interesting patterns from data in\n",
    "various applications. In particular, we emphasize prominent techniques for developing\n",
    "effective, efficient, and scalable data mining tools.\n",
    "This chapter is organized as follows. In Section 1.1, you will learn why data mining is\n",
    "in high demand and how it is part of the natural evolution of information technology.\n",
    "Section 1.2 defines data mining with respect to the knowledge discovery process. Next,\n",
    "you will learn about data mining from many aspects, such as the kinds of data that can\n",
    "be mined (Section 1.3), the kinds of knowledge to be mined (Section 1.4), the kinds of\n",
    "technologies to be used (Section 1.5), and targeted applications (Section 1.6). In this\n",
    "way, you will gain a multidimensional view of data mining. Finally, Section 1.7 outlines\n",
    "major data mining research and development issues."

    "“We are living in the information age” is a popular saying; however, we are actually living\n",
    "in the data age. Terabytes or petabytes1 of data pour into our computer networks, the\n",
    "World Wide Web (WWW), and various data storage devices every day from business,\n",
    "society, science and engineering, medicine, and almost every other aspect of daily life.\n",
    "This explosive growth of available data volume is a result of the computerization of\n",
    "our society and the fast development of powerful data collection and storage tools.\n",
    "Businesses worldwide generate gigantic data sets, including sales transactions, stock\n",
    "trading records, product descriptions, sales promotions, company profiles and performance, and customer feedback. For example, large stores, such as Wal-Mart, handle\n",
    "hundreds of millions of transactions per week at thousands of branches around the\n",
    "world. Scientific and engineering practices generate high orders of petabytes of data in\n",
    "a continuous manner, from remote sensing, process measuring, scientific experiments,\n",
    "system performance, engineering observations, and environment surveillance.\n",
    "Global backbone telecommunication networks carry tens of petabytes of data traffic\n",
    "every day. The medical and health industry generates tremendous amounts of data from\n",
    "medical records, patient monitoring, and medical imaging. Billions of Web searches\n",
    "supported by search engines process tens of petabytes of data daily. Communities and\n",
    "social media have become increasingly important data sources, producing digital pictures and videos, blogs, Web communities, and various kinds of social networks. The\n",
    "list of sources that generate huge amounts of data is endless.\n",
    "This explosively growing, widely available, and gigantic body of data makes our\n",
    "time truly the data age. Powerful and versatile tools are badly needed to automatically\n",
    "uncover valuable information from the tremendous amounts of data and to transform\n",
    "such data into organized knowledge. This necessity has led to the birth of data mining.\n",
    "The field is young, dynamic, and promising. Data mining has and will continue to make\n",
    "great strides in our journey from the data age toward the coming information age.\n",
    "Example 1.1 Data mining turns a large collection of data into knowledge. A search engine (e.g.,\n",
    "Google) receives hundreds of millions of queries every day. Each query can be viewed\n",
    "as a transaction where the user describes her or his information need. What novel and\n",
    "useful knowledge can a search engine learn from such a huge collection of queries collected from users over time? Interestingly, some patterns found in user search queries\n",
    "can disclose invaluable knowledge that cannot be obtained by reading individual data\n",
    "items alone. For example, Google’s Flu Trends uses specific search terms as indicators of\n",
    "flu activity. It found a close relationship between the number of people who search for\n",
    "flu-related information and the number of people who actually have flu symptoms. A\n",
    "pattern emerges when all of the search queries related to flu are aggregated. Using aggregated Google search data, Flu Trends can estimate flu activity up to two weeks faster\n",
    "than traditional systems can.2 This example shows how data mining can turn a large\n",
    "collection of data into knowledge that can help meet a current global challenge."
